Questions:

1. List all possible plays:
5, 4, 2

2. If the deck is empty and the board has three cards left, must they be a J, Q, and K?
No, they could be a 3, 3, and 5.

3. Does the game involve any strategy?
Yes, because if you know that you are running out of a certain card that you need to make a combination you can't use it until that combination comes up. It is mostly luck though.
